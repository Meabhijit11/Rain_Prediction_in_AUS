# Rain_Prediction_in_Australia
## The problem statement
In this project, we try to answer the question that whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. We implement Logistic Regression with Python and Scikit-Learn.

To answer the question, I build a classifier to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia by training a binary classification model using Logistic Regression. I have used the Rain in Australia dataset downloaded from the Kaggle website for this project.

## Business Problem
Weather, and humankind's ability to accurately predict it, plays a critical role in many aspects of life. From farmers growing crops to a family planning a weekend vacation to logistical decision making within airlines, rain in particular is highly influential regarding plans. In some instances, the impact of rain can have large financial consequences. As a result, there is a strong interest to accurately forecast rain. The goal of this project is to use the available data to create a next-day prediction model for whether or not it will rain. Such a model could be utilized in a weather app for the benefit of the public at large.
